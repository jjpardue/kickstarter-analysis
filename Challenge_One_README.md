# Kickstarter Analysis

## Louise Nolastname

### An analysis of past Kickstarter theater/plays campaign goals vs. launch dates.  

After a successful campaign for Louise’s play, *Fever*, and in looking ahead to future endeavors, Louise has requested our team help in analyzing a number of past Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on goals and launch dates. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Because timing is everything, our team first set out understand the behaviors of over 4,000 campaigns across 21 countries from the year 2009 to 2017. We believed this would give us a broad scope of data to pull from, as well as allow us to determine which market and launch date could serve best for Louise’s next campaign. 

### Challenges

After compiling gross data, we had a fairly smooth transition in sorting and determining which information would be beneficial for Louise’s request. Because there were over 4,000 campaigns to scrub, the team felt we had enough information to make educated analyses. However, because the information is now over four years old and the world has suffered the effects of a global pandemic, we tread cautiously ahead due to overall spending and behavior changes across every country. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In our findings, we learned that the most successful campaigns were launched in May, June and July respectively. Adversely, Campaigns launched in May, July/October and July were likely to fail. The most campaigns canceled occurred in January.

We understand there is overlap here and believe that campaign goals directly affect campaign outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on data, we found that a campaign goal directly impacts the success of the campaign. Of the 4,113 projects analyzed, the following success/failure rates were determined: 

**Success Rates per Campaign Goals**
* $45,000 - 49,999 = 86%
* $40,000 - 44999 = 83%
* $1,000 - 4,999 = 79%

**Failure Rates per Campaign Goals**
* $50,000+ = 42%
* $30,000 - 34999 = 38%
* $35,000 - 39,999 = 36%

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### Results

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we have determined the following:

### Successful Outcomes Based on Goals and Launch Date

* Launch months: May/June/July
* Campaign Goals: $40,000 - 49,999

### Failed Outcomes Based on Goals and Launch Dates

* Launch months: May/June/July/October
* Campaign Goals: $50,000+

Again, we understand the overlap in success vs. failure months and submit that the reason for the failure was due to the unreasonable campaign goal. 

*What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*

Data shows us that summer months are subject to delivering the most successful outcomes for campaign launches. Adversely, summer months can also produce low success rates if campaigns goals are more than $50,000. 

*What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*

The best goal range for a campaign is $40,000 - 49,999. The least favorable goal is $50,000+. 

*What are some limitations of this dataset?*

We believe that the limitations set in this dataset could come from the fact that the data is more than four years old and with the affects of COVID-19 and it’s global impact, results could vary had we pulled the most recent nine-year data range. 

*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*

It would be interesting to understand which countries had the highest success and failure rates and how those compared to launch dates and campaign goals. As well, it would be of interest to understand which plays by genre garnered the most or least funding.
